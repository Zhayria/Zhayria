## About Me

I'm a Computer Science Graduate actively developing skills in **Cybersecurity**, **Python Programming**, and **Security Awareness Tools**. I enjoy building projects that bridge theory and real-world application — especially tools that raise awareness around social engineering and endpoint security.

I’m currently focused on expanding my cybersecurity knowledge through self-directed projects and hands-on labs.
