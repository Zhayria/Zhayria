##  About Me

I'm a computer science graduate actively developing skills in **cybersecurity**, **Python programming**, and **security awareness tools**. I enjoy building projects that bridge theory and real-world application — especially tools that raise awareness around social engineering and endpoint security.

I’m currently focused on expanding my cybersecurity knowledge through self-directed projects and hands-on labs.
